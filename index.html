<blockquote cite="Angus Maddison - The World Economy -- A Millenial Perspective">
<p>"Quantification clarifies issues which qualitative analysis leaves fuzzy. It is more readily contestable
and likely to be contested. It sharpens scholarly discussion, sparks off rival hypotheses, and contributes
to the dynamics of the research process. It can only do this if the quantitative evidence and the nature
of proxy procedures is described transparently so that the dissenting reader can augment or reject
parts of the evidence or introduce alternative hypotheses."</p>
